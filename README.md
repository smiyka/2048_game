## 2048 Game Rules

1. In this game, you can combine tiles containing the same numbers until they reach the number 2048.<br>
2. The tiles can contain only integer values starting from 2, and that are a power of two, like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on.<br>
3. Ideally, you should reach the 2048 tile within the smallest number of steps.<br>
4. The board has dimension of 4 x 4 tiles, so that it can fit up to 16 tiles. If the board is full, and there is no possible move to make like merging tiles together - the game is over.<br>
5. You can move cells with keyboard arrows.<br>
